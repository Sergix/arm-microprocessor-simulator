Type (TType)x	
-> TypeData
   rr. _type
 + Instruction (TInstruction)
=> InstrDataRegImmShift
   rr. _instr
   rr. _type_data
   
For example, to get Rm from a InstrDataImmShift (assuming op is the instruction struct instance)
   op._type_data.get_type().get_rm()
   
   
Using bitmatch in the CPU decode step means that the following are determined in the lowest-level instruction struct:
	1. Opcode
	2. Type
	3. 
	
1. Caller expects Instruction type.
2. Have Instruction struct have an enum field referring to the instruction type.
3. On the execute step, match the instruction type to a first-class function that receives the Instruction.
  -> Functions get_rm, get_rn, store_constant, get_LSM_code, etc. are
     first-class rather than as objects.
