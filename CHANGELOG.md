# ARMSim Project Changelog

## Details

Each *week* contains the days the project was worked on, and each day contains three sections:

1. Progress — what was accomplished, and how long it took
2. Sources (optional) — important references
3. Tests (optional) — any significant tests that were passed

If a project checkpoint was completed, a note (**Checkpoint Reached: [Details]**) is to be added at the top of the day's details.
